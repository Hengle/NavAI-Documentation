<div class="textblock"><h1><a class="anchor" id="NavMesh"></a>
NavMesh</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="hres"></a>
Heightmap Resolution</h2>
<p>Resolution of the NavMesh Heightmap.</p>
<p>The Heightmap is used for baking the navigation mesh and also for height queries, agent height positioning and triangulation rendering.</p>
<p>Higher Heightmap resolutions can result in a higher quality NavMesh baking where the mesh generation process can detect smaller world details with more precision. Increasing the heightmap resolution, however, will greaty increase the time it takes to bake a NavMesh and will also make larger Heightmap files. Heightmap resolution has little no impact on runtime performance other than memory usage.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tres"></a>
Tilemap Resolution</h2>
<p>Resolution of the Tilemap used for NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>Higher Tilemap resolutions can result in higher quality NavMesh baking, but will significantly slow down the baking process. It is recommended to use lower values for grid based worlds if fast baking is desired. The Tilemap is used exclusively for NavMesh baking and will not affect runtime performance at all.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mslope"></a>
Max Slope</h2>
<p>Maximum slope angle the agents can walk over.</p>
<p>The maximum slope angle defines which slopes or ramps agents are able to traverse. If a ramp has a slope angle lower than the Max Slope variable, then the agent will be able to walk up that ramp.</p>
<p>Setting this value too high can result in poorly defined obstacles contour, while setting it too low can result in agents not being able to walk up some ramps.</p>
<p>This variable is defined in degrees.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sheight"></a>
Step Height</h2>
<p>Maximum step height the agents can walk up.</p>
<p>The step height defines which steps the agent can walk up or not. If a stairs have steps which are lower than the Step Height variable, then agents will be able to walk up those stairs.</p>
<p>Setting this value too high can result in agents being able to walk up obstacles that they should not be able to, while setting it too low can result in agents being unable to walk up stairs.</p>
<p>This variable is defined in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Precision"></a>
Precision</h2>
<p>NavMesh baking precision.</p>
<p>The Precision variable defines how much the polygon decimation process can simplify the obstacles contour during NavMesh Baking.</p>
<p>Larger precision values will generate simpler polygons with less vertices, which also results in triangulations with less triangles, whereas lower precision values will preserve the obstacles contour more.</p>
<p>Setting this value too high can result in poorly defined obstacle contour, while setting it too low can result in obstacles not being simplified enough, giving them a pixelized look.</p>
<p>Precision can affect runtime peformance by reducing or increasing the number of mesh triangles. A NavMesh with more triangles will be slower than a NavMesh with fewer triangles.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use a value that simplifies your polygons just enough to remove excessive vertices and the grid-like aspect of the contour.</p>
<p>This value is defined in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="parea"></a>
Min. Polygon Area</h2>
<p>Minimum polygon area filter for NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>Polygons whose area is smaller than this variable will be completely ignored during the baking process. This includes both areas that are obstructed $($Obstacles$)$ and areas that are not obstructed $($Walkable areas$)$.</p>
<p>Increasing this value can remove undesired noise from the navigation mesh, but setting it too high can cause the baking process to completely ignore some obstacles.</p>
<p>This value is defined in square meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rarea"></a>
Min. Region Area</h2>
<p>Minimum region area filter for NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>Polygons whose area is smaller than this variable and are walkable areas will be completely ignored during the baking process. This will result in these small areas that should be walkable being considered obstacles and unwalkable.</p>
<p>Increasing this value can remove areas that are too small for agents, but setting it too high can result in some areas that should be walkable to be considered obstacles and unwalkable.</p>
<p>This value is defined in square meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mclr"></a>
Min. Clearance</h2>
<p>Minimum area clearance filter for NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>Walkable tiles whose clearance value is smaller than this value will be flagged as obstacles and unwalkable. This will result in thin corridors not being added to the NavMesh as walkable areas.</p>
<p>Setting this value too low can cause the navigation mesh to consider narrow corridors in it's triangulation, whereas setting it too high can remove corridors that should be walkable. This variable has a huge impact on baking performance, and it is recommended to set it to zero for runtime baking if baking speed is important.</p>
<p>It is important to note that even if this value is set to 0, and te triangulation takes corridors that are too narrow, agents whose collision radius are too large for this corridor width will still be unable to traverse it. However, for these cases to work properly, the mesh must have Calculate Clearances set to true.</p>
<p>For editor mesh baking, it is recommended to set this value to the minimum agent size. For runtime baking, it is recommended to set this value to zero.</p>
<p>This value is defined in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mheight"></a>
Max. Height</h2>
<p>Maximum NavMesh walkable height filter.</p>
<p>Any tile with height greater than this value will be treated as unwalkable.</p>
<p>Setting this value too low can result in some walkable areas be considered not walkable because they are too high.</p>
<p>This value is in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="lmask"></a>
Layer Mask</h2>
<p>Layer Mask filter for NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>Any obstacle whose layer is not in this Layer Mask will be ignored during the baking process.</p>
<p>This layer mask should contain all layers used by obstacles that should be considered by this Navigation Zone.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="zpos"></a>
Zone Position</h2>
<p>The zone world position.</p>
<p>This is the same as the Tranform position.</p>
<p>The zone's volume should contain all of it's obstacles.</p>
<p>This value is in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="zsize"></a>
Zone Size</h2>
<p>The zone world size.</p>
<p>This is not the same as the Transform scale.</p>
<p>The zone's volume should contain all of it's obstacles.</p>
<p>This value is in meters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="scol"></a>
Scan Colliders</h2>
<p>Toggles scanning all scene Colliders when baking the NavMesh.</p>
<p>This will add a Obstacle Component to any GameObject with a Collider. Note that Agents with collliders will not be considered during this scan.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="smesh"></a>
Scan Meshes</h2>
<p>Toggles scanning all scene Meshes when baking the NavMesh.</p>
<p>This will add a Obstacle Component to any GameObject with a Mesh. Note that Agents with collliders will not be considered during this scan.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="calclr"></a>
Calculate Clearances</h2>
<p>Toggles calculating of triangle clearances.</p>
<p>Triangle clearance is used to tell whether or not a path for an agent can traverse a triangle according to the agent's collision radius.</p>
<p>This process slows down the triangulation process both during NavMesh baking and during NavMesh runtime updates.</p>
<p>It is recommended to turn this feature on if there are narrow corridors on the navigation mesh that larger agents cannot traverse. If all agents can traverse all corridors on the mesh, then this can be turned off for runtime performance gains.</p>
<p>When unsure on how to use this variable, set it to true.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="calh"></a>
Calculate Heights</h2>
<p>Toggles Triangulation Vertex height calculation.</p>
<p>Triangulation Vertex height is used exclusively for NavMesh rendering. It does not have any impact on the physics outcome of the navigation algorithm.</p>
<p>Calculating heights can have some impact on both NavMesh baking and Triangulation runtime updates.</p>
<p>When NavMesh rendering is desired, set this value to true.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rbak"></a>
Robust Baking</h2>
<p>Toggles robust polygon decimation during NavMesh baking.</p>
<p>By default, polygon decimation will remove any unnecessary vertices from the polygons according to the zone's precision value. This operation, however, can cause polygons to intersect each other. Turning Robust Baking on can prevent this intersection from happening.</p>
<p>Robust Baking is only important if the zone's precision value is too high, which can cause polygon decimation to remove more vertices than it should.</p>
<p>Robust Baking has a huge impact on NavMesh baking, and should be turned off for runtime baking if speed is important.</p>
<p>It is recommended not to use this feature unless NavMesh errors are encountered.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="aagnt"></a>
Arrange Agents</h2>
<p>Toggles parenting Agents under the zone transform.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="aobst"></a>
Arrange Obstacles</h2>
<p>Toggles parenting Obstacles under the zone transform.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ater"></a>
Arrange Terrains</h2>
<p>Toggles parenting Terrains under the zone transform.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ebm"></a>
Editor Baking Mode</h2>
<p>Automatic: While not in play mode, the NavMesh will automatically bake every few seconds.</p>
<p>Manual: The NavMesh will not bake periodically, and the Generate Mesh button must be used to bake the NavMesh in the editor.</p>
<p>Even though most of the mesh baking runs in the background, automatic baking can cause some lag spikes in the editor, and it is recommended to turn it off when experiencing lag problems.</p>
<p>It is important to know that changes made during these updates cannot be undone with the editor Undo operation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="eidm"></a>
Execute In Edit Mode</h2>
<p>Execute In Edit Mode will run most of the navigation algorithms while not in play mode. This allows the NavMesh to automatically update when dynamic obstacles are added or moved on the editor, and also allows agents to collide with obstacles and other agents.</p>
<p>Mesh And Agents: Both NavMesh and Agents will be updated while not in play mode. Mesh Only: Only the mesh will be updated while not in play mode. Agents Only: Only the agents will be updated while not in play mode. None: NavMesh and Agents will be updated while not in play mode.</p>
<p>It is important to know that changes made during these updates cannot be undone with the editor Undo operation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rev"></a>
Revert To Default</h2>
<p>Reverts all the NavZone settings to the default recommended values. These values may differ depending on the Heightmap Resolution and Tilemap Resolution variables.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="gen"></a>
Generate Mesh</h2>
<p>Starts baking a new NavMesh for this Navigation Zone using the above settings.</p>
<p>Once started, NavMesh baking runs on the background and is automatically saved on the Navigation Zone when the process is complete. Note that this does not save the scene itself, and changes will be lost of the scene is not saved. </p>
